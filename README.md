Have you ever been listening to Spotify on your headphones when a coworker comes over to ask you a question? You take your headphones off to listen to their dilemma and suddenly find your self deep in a technical debate of tabs vs. spaces. Suddenly, you remember - did I remember to pause Spotify? Has it been playing this entire time? Now with Glancify, the answer is just a _glance_ away.
